# KMeans

1. Use doubly linked lists to represent the clusters.
2. Implement the k-means clustering algorithm.
3.  Output two text files: A.txt and B.txt representing the result of k-means clustering.
Each output file contains the observation numbers (printed one per line) of the data
points of that cluster.
